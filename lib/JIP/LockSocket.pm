JIP::LockSocket - application lock/mutex based on sockets

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use JIP::LockSocket;

    my $port = 4242;

    my $foo = JIP::LockSocket->new(port => $port);
    my $wtf = JIP::LockSocket->new(port => $port);

    $foo->port; # required
    $foo->addr; # defaults to 127.0.0.1

    $foo->lock;           # lock
    eval { $wtf->lock; }; # or raise exception

    # Can check its status in case you forgot
    $foo->is_locked; # 1
    $wtf->is_locked; # 0

    $foo->lock; # Re-locking changes nothing

    # But trying to get a lock is ok
    $wtf->try_lock;  # 0
    $wtf->is_locked; # 0

    # You can manually unlock
    $foo->unlock;

    # Re-unlocking changes nothing
    $foo->unlock;

    # ... or unlocking is automatic on scope exit
    undef $foo;
